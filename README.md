# Bitcoin-Bubbler

<b>Description</b>
As our first project we are creating a crypto-currency app, which will dynamically generate prices for primarily bitcoin but also all sorts of other cryptos. The app will take current prices and trends and display them for users, aswell as allow users to log their current currencies and amounts to show what the value is of their crypto-wallet. The app will also take the value of the current crypto and the value of the users wallet and display them in whichever currency that would like it displayed.
